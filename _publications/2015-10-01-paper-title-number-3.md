# excerpt: 'We propose FITNESS, (Fine Tune on New and Similar Samples), a flexible framework for detecting anomalies on data streams.

The core of our method is to finetune the anomaly detection system only on recent, similar examples, before predicting an anomaly score.'

We propose FITNESS, (Fine Tune on New and Similar Samples), a flexible framework for detecting anomalies on data streams. We show that in case when the data stream has a gaussian distribution, FITNESS is provably both robust and adaptive. The core of our method is to finetune the anomaly detection system only on recent, similar examples, before predicting an anomaly score.
